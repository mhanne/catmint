 gem install gir_ffi-0.3.1.gem && cd ..

 catmint


== usage

you probably know how a browser works, clicking on links and all that...
here's what makes catmint different.

=== url bar

enter a url/domain and it takes you there. enter a search term and it searches the archive.
you can always focus the url bar with <b>Ctrl-l</b>.

=== follow link

press <b>Ctrl-f</b> and a number will appear next to each link. enter that number
(or the link title using autocompletion) and it will follow that link.

=== archive

every page you visit is stored on disk and indexed so you can do full-text queries
and browse every page you ever saw offline. search for it using the url bar and click the
"Archive" link in the results.


== todo

* web search
* form fillers / passwords
* cookies
* bookmarks
* better index (sql LIKE queries suck)
* rules to enable scripts/plugins/etc per page
* rules to block resources by url
* web inspector
